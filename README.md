_Prepare the data_ - DONE

~~Clean data in pandas from 0’s (instances where users didn’t submit rating) and brushing up the data frame.

Divide the total amount of ratings and reviews into 2 categories: negative and positive and create two new data frames.

Check what kind of data is presented after the cleaning.~~

_Logistic regression_

Implement the sigmoid function.

Test the function.

Gradient descent function.

Test the function and construct a synthetic test case using numpy, apply gradient descent.

_Extracting the features_

Extract the 1st feature, which is going to be a number of positive ratings/reviews

Extract the 2nd feature, which is going to be a number of negative ratings/reviews

Train the logistic regression classifier on the above-mentioned features

Test the classifier
